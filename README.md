# Booking Buddy

This project scrapes data live from Airbnb and Booking.com to find you the best deals based on your trip details, and uses our rating algorithm to show your order them and present them. It is one stop for finding both Airbnb's and Hotels at the same time. 

The main file is the webserver6.py file. It contains the code for the scraping, ranking, and outputting the data for the user to view places.
